# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

Routes I'm working on for this project:

| Method     |  Path     |          Purpose         |
|----------- |-----------|--------------------------|
|   GET      |  /        |        Home page         |
|   GET      |  /places  |     Places index page    |
|   POST     |  /places  |     Creat new place      |
|   GET      |  /places/new |  Form page for creating a new place |
|   GET      | /places/:id  | Details about a particular place    |
|   PUT      | /places/:id | Update a particular place |
|   GET      |  /places/:id/edit | Form page for editing an existing place |

Colors are bright and fun, which is the theme for the website.
